# Frequently Asked Questions

### &#x20;Appointment Scheduling

### Can I schedule cataract surgery directly?

For cataract surgery scheduling, patients cannot be scheduled directly by the Patient Access Center. Instead:

* The patient must first have a comprehensive eye exam with a US Eye provider to evaluate the cataract and discuss surgery options.
* If surgery is recommended, the provider or surgical coordinator will handle the surgery scheduling.
* You can assist by scheduling the comprehensive exam or follow-up visit with the appropriate provider.
* Make sure to document the patient's interest in cataract surgery in the appointment notes.

### Insurance and Billing

### Can I provide copay information to patients?

No you cannot. The patient's insurance company is the only entity that can provide accurate and up-to-date information about their policy, coverage, or costs. Since the insurance company writes and manages the patient's policy, they have access to all the necessary details and are best positioned to answer questions.

Please do not send these types of inquiries to RCM, instead put it back on the patient to reach out to their insurance company.

### Do retina specialists accept vision plans?

Retina specialists generally do not accept vision-only insurance plans because retina care is considered medical eye care, which requires medical insurance coverage.

Most retina specialists at US Eye, including Dr. Alexander Eaton, Dr. Veronica Kon Graversen, and Dr. Tanuj Banker, accept medical insurance plans but not vision-only plans.

Patients with vision insurance only may need to pay out-of-pocket for retina specialist visits or obtain medical insurance coverage.

If you want, I can help you check specific insurance plans or provide guidance on how to discuss this with patients.

### Does Dr. Banker accept Aetna Medicare Advantage Gold HMO?

Dr. Tanuj Banker does not accept Aetna Medicare Advantage Gold HMO medical insurance.

### Who should I refer billing questions to?

If a patient calls regarding an outstanding balance, you should direct them to the Patient Financial Services (PFS) or Billing Department. This team handles billing questions, payment plans, and account balances.

You can offer to take their contact information and have the billing team reach out, or provide the patient with instructions on how to contact Patient Financial Services through the call center.

### Medical Procedures and Protocols

### How should I handle red eye calls?

When a patient calls with a red eye, follow these steps to determine the appropriate course of action:

1. **Identify Symptoms and Duration:** Ask the patient about their symptoms and how long they have been experiencing them. Document all symptoms, which eye(s) they affect, and the duration.
2. **Determine Urgency:** Use the following criteria to assess the urgency:
   * **Emergency (Same Day):** Acute red eye with or without discharge, sudden onset of floaters/flashes, or any trauma to the eye.
   * **Urgent (24–48 Hours):** Moderate redness/pain for a week.
   * **Non-Urgent (Next Available):** Mild ocular irritation/redness.
3. **Schedule Appointment:**
   * **Emergency:** Schedule a same-day appointment with an OD at CFS or an OD/MD at LEA and SFEC. If no same-day spots are available, send an ICP communication to the Patient Care Team and mark it as urgent.
   * **Urgent:** Schedule within 24–48 hours with an OD or the patient's primary provider if they are established.
   * **Non-Urgent:** Schedule the next available appointment.
4. **Inform the Patient:** Advise the patient that they may be dilated during the visit, which can cause blurry vision and light sensitivity for several hours. They should arrange transportation as they should not drive afterward.
5. **Create an ICP Task:** If you are unable to schedule immediately, create an ICP task with the appropriate urgency level and inform the patient that clinical staff will respond as soon as possible.

By following these steps, you ensure that the patient receives the appropriate level of care based on the urgency of their symptoms.

### How long should contacts be discontinued before cataract consultation?

**Soft Daily/Extended Wear:** 1 Week **Toric Daily Wear:** 2 Weeks **Hard / RGP / PMMA:** 3 Weeks **Scleral (for Keratoconus only):** Do NOT Discontinue

### How long is a cataract consultation?

"Your consultation will take approximately 2–3 hours. This time allows for a comprehensive exam and all necessary testing to ensure the highest level of care."

### Will patients be dilated for cataract consultations?

Yes, patients are typically dilated during a cataract consultation to allow the provider to thoroughly examine the lens and retina. Dilation helps in assessing the cataract and planning for surgery.

&#x20;

(Source: Patient Access Center Master Guide → Cataract Consultation Preparation)

### How long are cataract consultations valid?

Cataract consultations are typically valid for 90 days from the date of the consultation. Within this period, the patient can proceed with scheduling surgery without needing a new consultation.

If the surgery is not scheduled within 90 days, a new consultation may be required to reassess the patient's condition.

&#x20;

(Source: Patient Access Center Master Guide → Cataract Surgery Scheduling)

### Can patients schedule cataract consultations without referrals?

**If Patient Has Referral**

Criteria:

* Diagnosed cataracts ready for removal
* Complaints of blurry vision, glare, or night driving difficulty

Instructions:

* Schedule with preferred provider.
* If no preferred provider, schedule with first available in patient's preferred location.
* Note contact lens status and discontinuation timing in appointment details (see chart below).

**If Patient Does NOT Have Referral**

* Check Phreesia or ICP for documentation.
* Ask about last eye exam. If >1 year ago, follow Primary Eye Care Protocol.
* Request fax of last eye exam if diagnosis is unclear.
* If exam is vague, send ICP communication to the provider team to confirm readiness.
* Document records status in "Physician Relations / Records."
* Enter surgeon's name in Referring Physician field (never leave blank).(Follow standard Referral Management Protocol)

**Additional Criteria for Patients WITHOUT Referral:**

Before scheduling a Cataract Consult for a self-referral, confirm they meet typical criteria (e.g., age > 55, experiencing symptoms like blurry vision, glare, night driving difficulty).

If unsure based on patient description or if last exam was >1 year ago, consider scheduling for Primary Eye Care first, or request records per the protocol.

If patient insists on Cataract consult despite lack of clear diagnosis/recent exam, document this clearly.

### Injection and Treatment Protocols

### How should I handle late injection appointments?

Patient will need to have their appointment rescheduled as a dilated Fundus due to the injection going 10 business days past of the due date.

For all other injection-scheduling questions, send an ICP message to the doctor's team.

### Can I schedule refraction rechecks with different providers?

Refraction rechecks should always be scheduled with the same provider who performed the comprehensive exam. Patients should consult an optician first to check their glasses before scheduling a refraction recheck.

### What about patients who haven't been seen in 3+ months?

If a patient hasn't been seen in 3+ months, a comprehensive exam is scheduled, not just a refraction.

### Referrals and New Patients

### How do I handle new patients with retina consultations?

For a new patient with a referral for a retina consultation, you can schedule the appointment with any of the retina specialists at the appropriate location. Available retina specialists include:

* Dr. Alexander Eaton, MD
* Dr. Veronica Kon Graversen, MD
* Dr. Tanuj Banker, MD

Please collect the following information from the patient to proceed:

* Full name and date of birth
* Contact information
* Referral details (referring doctor's name and contact if available)
* Preferred days and times for the appointment
* Any relevant medical history or notes about the retina condition

&#x20;

(Source: Patient Access Center Master Guide → New Patient Scheduling; Retina Health Center; Provider Reference Guide)

### Can retina consultations be scheduled without referrals?

For a retina consultation, a referral is typically required before scheduling the appointment. If the patient does not have a referral, you should:

* Inform the patient that a referral from their primary care provider or another eye doctor is needed.
* Offer to assist the patient in obtaining a referral or provide guidance on how to get one.
* Alternatively, schedule a comprehensive eye exam with a primary eye care provider who can evaluate and, if needed, generate a referral to a retina specialist.

&#x20;

### Emergency and Urgent Care

### How do I handle emergency eye situations?

For emergency eye situations, patients with acute symptoms like sudden sharp pain should be scheduled for same-day appointments. The Patient Access Center will schedule the first available opening on the same day. If no emergency (ER) spot is open, they may schedule any available short or long slot. If no same-day spots are available, an urgent ICP message is sent to the Patient Care Team to assist. They also check availability across all offices in the region, including satellite locations, to find an opening.

If it is late in the day (3:30 PM–5:00 PM), a warm transfer to the office is attempted; if unavailable, an ICP message is sent for follow-up.

Please note: If the patient is established, they are scheduled with their primary provider whenever possible. If post-op or comanaged, they should see their comanaging provider.

(Source: Patient Access Center Master Guide → Emergency Triage Protocol, Appointment Scheduling & Urgent Care)

### Medication and Post-Op Care

### Can I provide medication information to patients?

The agents do not provide medical or drop information.

Please provide the names of the eye drops you were prescribed or if you recall any specific instructions given. If you need, I can create a Patient Task to notify the provider team who manage post-op care for detailed guidance or rescheduling.

Remember, all post-op scheduling and medication questions are handled by the call center, so I can assist with any follow-up appointments or clarifications you need.

For detailed post-op care and dilation information, you can refer to the Dilation Key and Post-Op Care sections here:\
https://us-eye-florida.gitbook.io/pac-guide/dilation-key (Source: Patient Access Center Master Guide → Dilation Key; Post-Op Care sections)

### Do we provide dilation key guides to patients?

We do not provide a dilation key guide to our patients. If a patient is asking if they will be dilated at their upcoming visit the agent can refer to the guide and inform the patient if they should expect to be dilated or not at their upcoming visit.

### Specialized Services

### Do we perform strabismus surgery?

We do not perform strabismus surgery at any of our US Eye Florida locations. We also should not be giving out medical information related to pre or post operative care or expectations.

### Do we accept VA insurance?

US Eye does accept VA health benefits, specifically through the Optum VA-Veterans Affairs Community Care Network (CCN). However, VA patients must have the VA schedule their appointment directly, as they cannot self-schedule. The authorization for the appointment should be checked in the system, and if none exists, the VA needs to send a new one.

Regarding locations, US Eye has multiple offices in Florida, including:

* The Villages (Sharon Morse Building attached to UF Health The Villages Hospital)
* Wildwood
* Leesburg
* Tavares
* Fort Myers
* Naples
* Cape Coral

These locations provide various eye care services and participate in VA coverage via Optum VA (CCN).

To assist the patient further, please ask:

* Do they have an existing VA authorization for the appointment?
* Which location is most convenient for them?
* Do they have any secondary insurance?

This will help ensure proper scheduling and insurance verification. If you need more details on specific locations or providers, I can provide that as well.

For a 66-year-old patient with Medicare, would be better suited for a cataract consultation.

### If Rural Health Clinic (RHC) patient is having an Emergency do i need permission or can i just get them in?

For a Rural Health Clinic (RHC) patient needing emergency care (ER), you does indeed need prior permission to get them in for urgent evaluation. Emergency situations warrant immediate attention, so you should attempt to reach the office as soon as possible for an urgent or same-day appointment.

The plans accepted will vary by doctor so be sure to check specifics.
