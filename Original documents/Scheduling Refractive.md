- LASIK (laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis)

- Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK)
- Implantable Contact Lenses (EVO ICL)

## Important Reminders

- If you are offering an appointment that is more than 10 days out, please book the appointment but also offer to place the patient on the waitlist.  
- Refractive Consults are $128 and are not covered by insurance or vision plans.  
- Inform the patient that payment in full is due at check-in.

## Process

### If Patient Has Referral

**Offer patient the option of scheduling as a cataract consult (through insurance) if:**

- Has NOT had cataract or lens replacement surgery  
- Has symptoms such as blurred vision, glare, or trouble driving at night  
- Is 55 years old or older

> If patient meets these criteria, schedule a cataract consultation with the first available provider or their preferred provider.

**Steps:**

1. Check Phreesia and/or ICP for referral documents.  
2. If missing, instruct the patient to send in referral/last note prior to the appointment.  
3. Schedule with the referring provider.  
4. Notate in APPT DETAILS if the patient wears contact lenses and confirm they were instructed on discontinuation.

### If Patient Does NOT Have Referral

- Confirm they are pursuing refractive or laser vision correction surgery.  
- If no preference, offer next available appointment in the most convenient location.  
- Enter the surgeon's name in the *Referring Physician* field to indicate self-referral.  
  > **Note:** This field should never be left blank.  
- Notate contact lens usage and discontinuation instruction in APPT DETAILS.

## Contact Lens Instructions

> Wearing contact lenses can affect corneal measurements. Ask:  
> "What type of contact lenses do you wear?"  
> Advise accordingly and document in NextGen appointment notes.

**Discontinue Contact Lenses Prior to Consultation:**

| Lens Type                  | Florida              |
| -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Soft Daily / Extended Wear | 1 week               |
| Toric Daily Wear           | 2 weeks              |
| Hard / RGP / PMMA          | 3 weeks              |
| Scleral for Keratoconus    | *Do Not Discontinue* |

> "Please make sure to bring your scleral lens case and solution to your appointment as you will be asked to remove your lenses during the exam."

- **Use "DNM" in appointment details** to prevent being offered an earlier appointment.

## FAQs

### 1. Will my eyes be dilated?

> "As part of the examination, your eyes may be dilated to allow for a thorough assessment. Your vision may be blurry and your eyes sensitive to light for several hours. Please arrange transportation accordingly."

### 2. How long is the consultation?

> "Due to the complexity of the exam and the comprehensive nature of diagnostic testing, your consultation may last up to three hours."

## Pre-Op / Post-Op Care

  > "Completing the registration in advance will help expedite check-in and allow more time for your care."
