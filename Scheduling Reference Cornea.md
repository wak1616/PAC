## Cornea Overview

- **Definition**

- **Common Conditions**  
  - Keratoconus  
  - Fuchs' Dystrophy  
  - Pterygium  
  - Pinguecula  
  - Complex anterior segment surgery and iris repair (**Dr. Elizabeth Davis** only)  
  - Severe dry eye and ocular surface disease (must be referred by an optometrist)

## Process

### If Patient Has Referral

1. Check Phreesia/ICP Documents to confirm the referral is for a Cornea Consultation.  
2. Have the patient's last note or referral sent in if not found.  
3. Schedule with the referring provider (the name on the referral).

### If Patient Does **Not** Have Referral

1. Confirm the patient was diagnosed with a cornea condition by a physician (internal or external).  
2. Alert the patient that records are required; the appointment may be canceled if records don't arrive. Schedule at least **1 week** out (mark **DNM** in details).  
3. Document the records status in the Physician Relations / Records field.  
4. If no surgeon preference, offer the next available at the requested/most convenient location.  
5. Enter the surgeon's name in the Referring Physician field to indicate self-referral (never leave it blank).

## FAQs

1. **Q:** Do cornea consultations require dilation?  
   **A:** Yes (except for dry eye only appointments).  
   > "As part of the examination process, your eyes will be dilated to allow for a thorough assessment of your eye health. Due to the dilation, your vision may become blurry and your eyes more sensitive to light for several hours afterward. For your safety and comfort, it's important to have someone accompany you to the appointment who can drive you home afterward."

2. **Q:** How long do cornea consultations last?  
   **A:** Typically 2–3 hours.  
   > "Due to the complexity of the exam and the comprehensive nature of the diagnostic testing we'll be conducting, your consultation is likely to last between two to three hours. This extended time is necessary to ensure we gather all the information needed to provide you with the best possible care."

## Closing Reminders

- Ask if there is anything else you can assist with.  
- Advise the patient of dilation and 2–3 hour duration.  
- Encourage Phreesia pre-registration 5 days prior to appointment.  
> "Five days prior to your appointment, you will receive a message from Phreesia, our registration platform. Please confirm your appointment and complete the registration. This ensures a faster check-in and allows us to focus more on your care. Contact our office with any questions."

- Thank the patient and confirm appointment date/time/location.  
> **Example:**  
> "Thank you [Mr./Ms. Patient Last Name], we look forward to seeing you for your cornea consultation on [date] at [time] at our [office] location."
