# Scheduling Reference – Glaucoma

> **Scope:** This protocol details the process to schedule Glaucoma Consultations.

Glaucoma is a disease caused by increased fluid pressure within the eye, potentially damaging the optic nerve. If left untreated, it can lead to vision loss. Our surgeons offer treatments such as medications, SLT (Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty), MIGS (Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery), trabeculectomy, and tube implants.

## Process

### If Patient Has Referral
1. **Check Phreesia/ICP** documents to confirm it's for a Glaucoma Consultation.  
2. If referral isn't found, **alert the patient** to have it sent prior to the consultation.  
3. **Schedule** with the referring provider named on the referral.

### If Patient Does **Not** Have Referral
1. Confirm the patient **was diagnosed** with a Glaucoma condition by a physician.
   - If the patient was seen internally, check **ICP** for any note about a Glaucoma diagnosis or referral.  
2. **Alert the patient** that records are required. If they're not received, the appointment may be canceled.  
3. **Schedule** at least **1 week out** to allow time for records receipt. Mark **DNM** in appointment details to prevent booking earlier.  
4. **Document records status** in Physician Relations / Records field (NextGen).  
5. If no surgeon preference, offer the **next available** slot at the requested/most convenient location.  
6. Enter the surgeon's name in **Referring Physician** field to show self-referral. (Field must not be blank.)

## Pre-Op / Post-Op Care

All Pre-Op, Surgery, and 1-Day Post-Op visits are managed by the **surgical counselors**.  
- Create a **Patient Task** in ICP to notify the Surgical Counselor group (CFS, LEA, RHC, SFEC).

## FAQs

1. **Do glaucoma consultations require dilation?**  
   Yes. Dilation may blur vision and increase light sensitivity for several hours. We recommend someone to drive you home.

2. **How long do glaucoma consultations last?**  
   Typically **2–3 hours**, due to comprehensive diagnostic testing.

## Closing Reminders

- Ask if there is anything else you can help with.  
- Remind the patient about the 2–3 hour duration and possible **dilation**.  
- Encourage them to complete their **Phreesia** pre-visit workflow about 5 days before the appointment.  
  > "Completing registration in advance ensures all necessary information is in place and helps expedite check-in."  
- **Thank the patient** and confirm date/time/location.  
  - If the office differs from their usual location, reiterate the change.  
  - **Suggested**: "Thank you [Mr./Ms. Patient Last Name], we look forward to seeing you for your glaucoma consultation on [date] at [time] at our [office] location."
