# Scheduling – Cataract

> **Description:** This document outlines the procedure for scheduling cataract consultations, including provider info, referral and contact lens protocols, consultation logistics, and pre-/post-op care.

---

## Scope

This document details the process to schedule cataract consultations across US Eye locations.

---

## Cataract Overview

### What is a Cataract?

A cataract occurs when the natural lens becomes cloudy with age, leading to blurred vision, glare, difficulty driving at night, and possible blindness.

### Cataract Surgery

Cataract surgery removes the natural lens and replaces it with an intraocular lens (IOL). Femtosecond laser technology may be used to enhance precision and consistency if the surgeon determines the patient is a candidate.

### Vision Options

US Eye offers **advanced**, **custom**, and **basic** vision correction options. Surgeons may use a combination of technologies and lens implants.

## Process

### If Patient Has Referral

**Criteria:**

- Diagnosed cataracts ready for removal
- Complaints of blurry vision, glare, or night driving difficulty

**Instructions:**

1. Schedule with preferred provider.
2. If no preferred provider, schedule with first available in patient's preferred location.
3. Note contact lens status and discontinuation timing in appointment details (see chart below).

---

### If Patient Does NOT Have Referral

1. Check Phreesia or ICP for documentation.
2. Ask about last eye exam. If >1 year ago, follow **Primary Eye Care Protocol**.
3. Request fax of last eye exam if diagnosis is unclear.
4. If exam is vague, send ICP communication to the provider team to confirm readiness.
5. Document **records status** in "Physician Relations / Records."
6. Enter surgeon's name in **Referring Physician** field (never leave blank).

## Contact Lens Guidelines

**Script Prompt:**  
*"Wearing contact lenses can affect the shape of your cornea. To ensure accurate surgical measurements, you must stop wearing contacts before your consultation. What type of contact lenses do you wear?"*

> Record lens type and add "DNM" to appointment details to avoid early scheduling.

### Contact Lens Discontinuation Periods

| Lens Type                      | Florida            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Soft Daily/Extended Wear       | 1 Week             |
| Toric Daily Wear               | 2 Weeks            |
| Hard / RGP / PMMA              | 3 Weeks            |
| Scleral (for Keratoconus only) | Do NOT Discontinue |

> **Reminder:** Patients wearing scleral lenses should bring their case and solution to their consultation, as they will be asked to remove them during the exam.

## FAQs

1. **Do cataract consultations require dilation?**  
   Yes. _"As part of the examination process, your eyes will be dilated. This can cause blurry vision and light sensitivity for several hours. Please arrange transportation, as you should not drive afterward."_

2. **How long is the appointment?**  
   _"Your consultation will take approximately 2–3 hours. This time allows for a comprehensive exam and all necessary testing to ensure the highest level of care."_

## Pre-Op / Post-Op Care

- Pre-op, surgery, 1-day post-op, and LAL adjustments are scheduled/rescheduled/canceled by surgical counselors.
- If changes are needed, create a Patient Task in ICP and assign it to the appropriate group:

> **Groups:**  
> - CFS Surgical Counselors  
> - LEA Surgical Counselors  
> - RHC Surgical Counselors  
> - SFEC Surgical Counselors

## Closing Reminders

- Ask: _"Is there anything else I can help you with today?"_
- Remind:
  - Dilation and 2–3 hour exam
  - Contact lens removal requirements
  - Pre-visit workflow via **Phreesia** (5 days before appointment)

> _"You'll receive a message from Phreesia 5 days before your visit. Please complete registration online to streamline check-in and help us prepare for your care."_

- Confirm date/time/location and clarify if location is different than usual:
