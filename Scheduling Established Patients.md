> **Scope**: This procedure details the process for scheduling appointments for established patients.

## Providers

Appointments will typically be scheduled with the patient's existing provider unless the patient requests a change.  
- If the provider's schedule is more than 10 days out, the patient can be placed on the waitlist to be contacted if an appointment opens sooner.  
- **CFS / SFEC / LEA**: Do not schedule more than **two family members** in one day **per provider**.

## Process

1. **Verify Patient Information**  
   - In NextGen, go to the **Patient Information** tab. Verify and update demographics and insurance as needed.  
   - Review the **Insurance Guide** to confirm we accept the patient's plan.  
   - Ask if the patient has any issues needing immediate attention (see **Triage Protocol**).

2. **Check for Recalls / Follow-up**  
   - Click the **Recall icon** in NextGen's Patient Information bar to see active recalls (location, provider, event).  
   - If there are no active recalls, check the patient's **IntelleChartPRO Encounter Summary**. Look in the **Follow-Up** section of the most recent visit(s) for next recommended appointment details.

3. **Schedule the Appointment**  
   - Return to NextGen and click **Appointment Search Ahead** in the Patient Information bar.  
   - If the patient needs **multiple appointments** the same day (e.g., Visual Field + Comprehensive Exam), schedule from the **Appointment Book**:
     - Visual Field in the testing resource, then the Comprehensive Exam in the provider's resource 15-45 minutes later.
   - Complete the **Appointment Search** process and book the slot.  
   - If the provider noted in ICP that the patient is due for a **Comp–Est Adult** or **Comp–Est Child**, check the patient's insurance. If it's medical, schedule as **Comp–Medical** (or **Comp–Medicaid**), or if it's vision, schedule as **Routine Employee** or **Routine Vision Exam**.

4. **Referrals / Insurance Requirements**  
   - If the patient's insurance or HMO requires a referral/prior authorization, add **"Do Not Move" (DNM)** in the appointment details. This ensures the slot is not moved to an earlier date without the referral in place.

5. **Potential Dilation**  
   - Some appointments may require dilation. (See **Dilation Key** for more details.)  
   - **Suggested Script**:  
     "As part of the examination process, your eyes may be dilated to allow a thorough assessment of your eye health. Due to the dilation, your vision may be blurry and light-sensitive for several hours. For your safety and comfort, we recommend you bring someone who can drive you home afterward."

## Closing Reminders

1. **Ask if any further assistance is needed**  
   - Example: "Is there anything else I can help you with today?"

2. **Routine vs. Medical Coverage Notice**  
   - **Script**:  
     "Your appointment for a routine eye exam is scheduled for [date] at [time]. Should the physician identify a medical condition during your visit, we will give you updated insurance/financial information before proceeding. You can decide whether to address the medical condition then or schedule for a later time."

3. **Encourage Pre-Visit Workflow**  
   - **Script**:  
     "Five days before your appointment, you'll receive a message from Phreesia to confirm and complete registration. This helps speed up check-in and lets us focus on your care. If you have any trouble with registration, please let us know."

4. **Confirm Appointment Details**  
   - Thank the patient, confirm date/time/location.  
   - If the location differs from the patient's usual site, emphasize that change.  
   - **Suggested**:  
     "Thank you, [Mr./Ms. Patient Last Name]. We look forward to seeing you for your appointment on [date] at [time] at our [office] location."
