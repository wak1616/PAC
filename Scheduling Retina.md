# Scheduling Reference – Retina

> **Scope:** This protocol explains how to assist patients with Retina-related appointments and requests.

## Overview

The **retina** is a delicate, light-sensitive tissue lining the interior of the eye, essential for converting light into neural signals for vision. Common retinal conditions include but are not limited to:

- Macular Degeneration  
- Diabetic Retinopathy  
- Macular Pucker  
- Macula Hole  
- Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD)  
- Retina Tear  
- Retinal Detachment

## Important Reminders

1. **No Vision Plans**: Vision plans are not accepted for retina-related appointments.  
2. If the appointment is more than **10 days out**, you **must** offer to place the patient on the **waitlist**.  
3. Keep the patient with their existing provider whenever possible, unless they request a change. If a provider's schedule is fully booked, add the patient to the waitlist for a possible earlier opening.
4. **Injections**:
   - Must be scheduled at least **28 days** from the last injection (insurance will not reimburse earlier).  
   - If >8 weeks since last injection, schedule a **Dilated Fundus** exam.  
   - Rescheduling an injection should be done within **10 business days** of the original date.  
   - For all other injection-scheduling questions, send an **ICP message** to the doctor's team.

## Process

### Retinal Emergency

- Sudden onset of floaters, flashes, veil, or spider webs in vision, or recent (within 30 days) retinal tear/detachment → Refer to **Triage Protocol**.

### Glasses/Contact Lens Rx or Undiagnosed Patients

- If the patient wants a prescription update or does **not** have a confirmed retinal diagnosis, refer to **Primary Eye Care Protocol** instead.

---

## If Patient Has a Referral

1. Determine what the patient needs based on the retina reason/color key.  
2. If external referral: **alert** the patient that referral notes must be sent prior to the appointment.  
3. If existing patient with an internal doctor, check the last note in **ICP** to confirm what type of retina service is needed.  
4. Schedule with the referral provider (or first available if none is specified).  
5. Document the records status in the **Physician Relations / Records** field of the appointment screen.

---

## If Patient Does **Not** Have a Referral

1. The patient must provide documentation of a previously diagnosed retinal condition.  
2. Records must be sent prior to the appointment or it may be canceled.  
3. Schedule **at least 1 week out** to allow time for the records; mark **"DNM"** (Do Not Move) in the appointment details to prevent early rescheduling.  
4. Document the records status in the **Physician Relations / Records** field.  
5. If no provider preference, offer the **next available** time in the patient's requested or most convenient location.  
6. **Referring Physician Field**: Enter the provider's name to indicate self-referral (never leave blank).

## Pre-Op / Post-Op Care

- **Pre-Op, Surgery, and 1-Day Post Op** visits are handled by surgical counselors.  
- Create a **Patient Task** in **ICP** and notify the **Surgical Counselor group** (CFS, RHC) for the practice if needed.

---

## FAQs

### Injections
- Injections must adhere to strict timeframes. If rescheduling or canceling, verify the last injection date.  
- If the timing is unclear or the request is more than 10 days out, send an **ICP** message to the relevant team for guidance:
  - **CFS Clinic**  
  - **RHC Clinic**

### Will the Patient Be Dilated?
- **Retina consultations require dilation.**
- Vision may be **blurry** and eyes more **light-sensitive** for a few hours afterward.
- Recommend bringing someone who can **drive** them home.

### How Long Does the Consultation Last?
- Usually **2–3 hours**, due to the complexity of diagnostic tests.

## Closing Reminders

1. Ask if there is anything else the patient needs.  
2. Remind them about **dilation** and the **2–3 hour** appointment duration.  
3. Encourage completion of the **Phreesia** pre-visit workflow about **5 days** prior to expedite check-in.  
4. Thank the patient, confirm date/time/location, and **emphasize** if the location differs from their usual site.
