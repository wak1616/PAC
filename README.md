## Referral Management Protocol

This protocol outlines the standard steps when scheduling patients who may or may not have a formal referral for specialty services (e.g., Cornea, Cataract, Dermatology, Glaucoma, Oculoplastics Medical, Refractive, Retina).

### If Patient Has Referral

1. **Verify Referral:** Check **Phreesia**, **ICP Documents,** and/or **E-Faxes** to confirm the referral exists and is for the appropriate specialty consultation.
2. **Obtain Missing Referral:** If the referral document is not found, **notify the patient** that it needs to be sent over by the referring office _before_ the consultation appointment. The appointment may possibly be rescheduled if the referral is not received on time.
3. **Schedule:** Schedule the appointment with the provider named on the referral, if specified.
   1. **Note:** Sometimes the provider listed on the referral is not accurate â€” Please correct if necessary.
   2. If no provider is specified, schedule with the first available appropriate specialist at the patient's preferred location.
4. **Document:** Note the referral source and status in the appropriate appointment details field (e.g., Physician Relations / Records in NextGen).

### If Patient Does NOT Have Referral (Self-Referral)

1. **Confirm Condition:** Ask the patient about their symptoms or reason for seeking a specialty consultation. Ask if they have been diagnosed with a relevant condition by a previous eye care provider (internal or external).
   * If the patient was seen internally, check **ICP** for notes indicating a diagnosis or recommendation for a specialty consult.
   * If the reason is unclear or seems more appropriate for Primary Eye Care (e.g., needs glasses update, no specific diagnosis), follow the [Scheduling Primary Eye Care](./#scheduling-primary-eye-care) protocol first.
2. **Records Requirement (external referrals to internal specialists):** Alert the patient that **medical records** from their previous eye exam(s) related to the condition **may be required** for a specialist consultation. Explain that the appointment may be rescheduled by the specialist's team if records are not received.
3. **Schedule Out & Mark:** Schedule the appointment at least **1 week out** to allow time for records to be sent and reviewed. Mark **"DNM" (Do Not Move)** in the appointment details to prevent automated systems from moving the appointment earlier.
4. **Document Records Status:** Document the records request status (e.g., "Records requested from Dr. Smith on \[date]", "Patient to bring records") in the Physician Relations / Records field or appointment notes.
5. **Provider Selection:** If the patient has no surgeon/specialist preference, offer the next available appointment with an appropriate specialist at the requested/most convenient location.
6. **Referring Physician Field:** Enter the **specialist's name** being scheduled in the _Referring Physician_ field in NextGen to indicate it's a self-referral handled internally. **This field should never be left blank.**

## Emergency Triage Protocol

### Instructions for Patient with Acute Issues

This protocol details the steps taken to properly triage and schedule a patient with an acute issue.  

**NO medical advice should be given to the patient by PAC agents.**

***

### Surgical Check (If Patient had Surgery in Last 30 Days)

**If the patient is having an emergency or urgent issue** (see below) **and has had surgery with one of our doctors in the past 30 days:**

* Attempt to schedule a **same-day** appointment.
* If no same-day slot is available, triage via **ICP** message to the **Patient Care Team**, mark it **URGENT**.
* OK to schedule in the grey if needed (but if after 3:30PM do not schedule and only send triage task to Patient Care Team).
* If the patient is **comanaged**, they should see their comanaging physician. If the comanaging doctor is not available and patient needs to be scheduled to another provider, or if the patient requests a different provider, note it in the appointment details.

***

### Identify Urgency & Scheduling Process

1. Ask about the **symptoms**.
2. Ask about the **duration** of these symptoms.
3. **Determine the urgency** (Emergency, Urgent, or Non-Urgent) via the table below.
4. Document all symptoms, which eye(s) they affect, and how long they've been present.

The following guide outlines when to schedule appointment based on their symptoms:

| Emergency (Same Day)                                                           | Urgent (24â€“48 hrs)                                         | Non-Urgent (Next Avail)                                             |

### Emergency --> Same Day Appointment Required - Follow these instructions:

* **If New Patient**: Schedule with an **OD at CFS.**
  * **At LEA and SFEC, ODs or MDs see emergencies.**
* **If Established Patient:** Schedule with their **primary provider whenever possible**.
* If they are in a **post-op period** and **comanaged**, they should see their comanaging provider.

**Process**

* PAC schedules the **first available** opening (same day).
* If no ER spot is open, you may schedule in any open space (short or long)
* If no same day spots are available for that provider, send an **ICP** communication to the Patient Care Team of that region and mark **urgent**.
* If the patient's provider is out of the office, schedule with another provider in the region and note in the details their provider is out. **Check availability for all office locations in the region** **to include smaller satellite offices.**
* For **retina** patients (Dr. Banker or RHC): Triaged by an **OD first** for emergency appts. For retina emergency referrals (e.g. detachment or tear), send an **ICP** message to either Dr. Banker's team or RHC Pateint Care Team marked **urgent**. **Do not schedule**.
   - If this is a Dr. Banker patient that recently had an injection (2 weeks) and experiencing pain or decrease in vision, schedule them same day with an OD.
* If it's **3:30 PMâ€“5:00 PM**:
  * Attempt a warm transfer to the office.
  * If the office is unavailable, enter an **ICP** message to the Patient Care Team. The office will contact the patient directly to schedule.
* If uncertain or unable to schedule, **notify** the Patient Care Team in ICP (if new patient, see "ICP IntelleChart â€“ New Patient Task" below).
   - If a messaage is required to be sent, please make sure it is being sent to the proper **Patient Care Team** and include **all** details of symptoms.

***

### Urgent --> Appointment Within 48 Hours Required  - Follow these instructions:

* **If New Patient**: Schedule with **OD within 2 days** (although some MDs at SFEC and LEA see ERs as well)
* **If Established Patient**: Schedule with **primary provider whenever possible**.
* If in post-op/comanaged, see their comanaging provider if possible.

**Process**

* Schedule in the first available **orange ER spot** first.
* If unavailable orange ER spots, schedule for any 30 minute (long) spot that that provider has in next 48 hours.
* If unsure where to schedule, send **ICP** triage communication to the Patient Care Team in that region and mark **urgent**. Patient may need to see another provider if primary provider in the region is not available.

***

### Non-Urgent â€“ Next Available  - Follow these instructions:

* **If New Patient**: Schedule with **OD**.
* **If Established Patient**: Schedule with **primary provider**. For more information about scheduling non-urgent established patients, see "[Scheduling Established Patients](./#scheduling-established-patients)".
* **If Problem Focused Visit**: Schedule with primary provider. Evaluation of a specific, non-emergent eye issue (e.g. dry eye, mild redness or irritation, eyelid problems). Scheduled based on availability; not time-critical. Scheduled in a **blue short spot.**

**Process**

* Schedule the patient in the next available spot (within 2 weeks).
* If unsure or no spots are available, triage via ICP to the Patient Care Team in that region.

> **Note**: Sudden difficulty with distance/near vision should be treated as an emergency.

***

### Routing to Patient Care Teams via ICP

If you need to **triage via ICP** instead of scheduling immediately, see the table below to find the regional Patient Care Team to send message to:

* `CFS North Region Patient Care Team`
* `CFS Mid Region Patient Care Team`
* `CFS South Region Patient Care Team`
* `SFEC Patient Care Team`
* `LEA Patient Care Team`
* `RHC Patient Care Team`

**Add the provider's name at the beginning of the message** if known.\
Use **clear, concise language**â€”avoid abbreviations.

Document eye(s) affected, symptom details, cause if known, and duration.

Mark as **URGENT** if needed

**Include the patient's preferred location and best callback number.**

Inform the patient that staff will call them to discuss their symptoms and urgency.

_Refer to **NextGen Transfer to ICP process** for new patient ICP tasks_

***

#### Additional Reminders

1. If symptoms worsen before the scheduled appointment, advise the patient to **call back** immediately
2. Explain to the patient that he/she will likely be dilated for an Emergency visit.
3. If the patient isn't being seen the same day (non-Emergency) but has any of the following, they'll be **dilated** at the visit:
   * Blurred Vision
   * Decrease in Vision
   * Double Vision
   * NEW Floaters
   * Curtain, Veil, or Spider webs
4. Retina Health Center no longer sells vitamins. Please direct patients to call 855-479-3937 to order.

***

**Special Case: Dermatology concerns**:

* Email [Derm@centerforsight.net](mailto:Derm@centerforsight.net) with the patient's name, DOB, phone number, and symptoms.

***

## Contact Lens Discontinuation prior to Consultations

Cataract and Refractive surgery evaluations, as well as Cornea - Keratoconus evaluations, require patients to stop wearing contact lenses for a period beforehand to ensure accurate corneal measurements.

### Script Prompt

> "Wearing contact lenses can temporarily change the shape of your cornea. To ensure the most accurate measurements for your upcoming consultation \[or potential surgery], it's essential that you stop wearing your contact lenses for a specific period before your appointment. What type of contact lenses do you currently wear?"

_After determining the type, provide the relevant discontinuation period from the table below and document this instruction in the appointment details_

### Discontinuation Periods

| Lens Type                      | Florida            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Soft Daily/Extended Wear       | 1 Week             |
| Toric Daily Wear               | 2 Weeks            |
| Hard / RGP / PMMA              | 3 Weeks            |
| Scleral (for Keratoconus only) | Do NOT Discontinue |

> **Note:** Add **"DNM"** to the appointment details for patients requiring discontinuation to prevent Appointment Accelerator from offering earlier slots before the discontinuation period is met.

### Scleral Lens Note

> **Reminder for Scleral Lens Wearers:** Patients wearing scleral lenses should **bring their lens case and solution** to their consultation, as they will likely be asked to remove them during the exam. _(Confirm specific instructions if unsure for non-Keratoconus Scleral wearers or other complex cases)._

***

### Required Documentation

* Note "**72-hour rule**" clearly in appointment details.
* Extend appointment from 15 to 30 min when combining short slots.

### If Additional Requirements are Needed by Insurance

* If referral is required but not obtained, inform patient of self-pay requirement:

> "Your insurance requires a referral from your Primary Care Provider (PCP). It usually takes about seven business days. Without this referral, you can be seen as self-pay. You'll sign a Self-Pay form, and fees will be due at visit."

* Document PCP information clearly in the patient's chart and appointment notes.
* Note in the appointment details: "Pt is aware PCP referral is required; self-pay if not received."
* If the patient proceeds, load the insurance as "Self-Pay". DO NOT bill medical insurance.
* This also applies to Optum VA insurance patients if the authorization on file does not match the specific doctor being scheduled under the 72-hour rule.

## Standard Closing Procedures (Scripting)

### Basic Call Closing Steps

Follow these steps for **every** patient call to ensure consistent, professional service:

1. **Ask if additional assistance is needed**
   * "Is there anything else I can help you with today?"
2. **Encourage Phreesia pre-visit workflow** (5 days before appointment)
   * "You'll receive a message from Phreesia 5 days before your visit. Please complete registration online to streamline check-in and help us prepare for your care. If you have any trouble with registration, please contact us."
3. **Confirm appointment details**
   * Date, time, and location
   * If location differs from their usual office, **emphasize** the change
4. **Final confirmation**
   * "Thank you, \[Mr./Ms. Patient Last Name]. We look forward to seeing you on \[date] at \[time] at our \[location] office."

### Specialty-Specific Reminders

Include these additional reminders based on the appointment type:

#### Dilation Requirements

For appointments requiring dilation (most consultations and comprehensive exams):

* "As part of the examination process, your eyes will be dilated, causing blurry vision and light sensitivity for several hours. Please arrange transportation home, as you should not drive afterward."

#### Extended Appointment Duration

For consultations (typically 2-3 hours):

* "Due to the complexity of the exam and comprehensive diagnostic testing, your appointment may last 2-3 hours. This ensures we provide the highest level of care."

#### Contact Lens Discontinuation

When contact lens discontinuation is required:

* Confirm discontinuation period was explained
* "Remember to discontinue your contact lenses \[timeframe] before your appointment as discussed."
* For detailed contact lens discontinuation protocols, refer to the [Contact Lens Discontinuation Guide](Contact_Lens_Discontinuation_Guide.md)

#### Self-Pay/Fee Notifications

For appointments with fees not covered by insurance:

* Confirm fee amount and payment expectations
* "As discussed, the consultation fee is $\[amount] and payment is due at check-in."

#### Routine vs. Medical Coverage

For routine eye exams:

* "Your routine eye exam is scheduled for \[date/time]. If a medical condition is found, the physician will let you know about any insurance or financial responsibilities before proceeding with treatment that day. You can choose to proceed immediately or schedule the care for another time."

### Quick Reference

For detailed specialty-specific protocols, refer to the individual scheduling sections in this guide.

#### Important Reminders

1. Make certain that every appointment is scheduled in **time order.**
2. **Refraction rechecks** should always be scheduled with the **same provider** who performed the comprehensive exam. Patients should consult an optician first to check their glasses before scheduling a refraction recheck.
3. If a patient **hasn't been seen in 3+ months**, a **comprehensive exam** is scheduled, **not** just a refraction.
4. **Any OD** can see a patient for punctal plugs. Schedule in a light blue spot for a follow up and add in the appointment details: **"Punctal Plugs"** 
5. **CFS/SFEC/LEA**: Do not schedule more than **two family members** in one day **per provider**.
6. If you offer an appointment more than **10 days out**, you **must** offer to place the patient on the **waitlist** (in addition to scheduling them).
7. ROTC exams are only done by Dr. Middaugh at the CFS Brantley Rd location. There is a limit of **2 per day** (one in the AM and one in the PM). Scheduled as short visits with "ROTC Exam" in the appointment details.

#### Process

1. **OD vs. MD/DO**
   * **Optometrists (OD)** can treat, diagnose, and prescribe for most eye conditions. If surgery is needed, the OD will refer to a Surgeon.
2. **New vs. Established**
   * If it's been **more than three years** since the patient's last exam, schedule them using the appropriate **new patient** event.
   * For **Routine Employee** exams, see the **Employee Exams Protocol**.
   * **Vision plans** can only be used for **Routine Vision** exams. Check insurance acceptance, and ensure both medical + vision are listed in NextGen.
3. **Contact Lens (CL) Fittings**
   * **Established** patient with a CL fitting:
     * If not seen in **over one year**, schedule a **Comprehensive Exam** and note "CL" in details. The provider decides if the fitting can occur then or needs a separate visit.
   * All contact lens fittings must be scheduled in a **light blue spot either at the end of the morning or end of day.**
   * Confirm **type of lenses** in the appointment details, and ensure you schedule with a provider who fits that lens.
   * Patients must **wear** their contact lenses to the appointment and **bring** their lens prescription/info.
   * **New patients** cannot be scheduled directly for a Contact Lens Fitting. Schedule a **Comp Medical or Routine Vision** as a new patient exam instead. The provider will decide if the fitting can occur or if a separate appointment is required.
   * If externally referred for **specialty contact lens** (e.g., scleral), schedule at least **one week** out and use "DNM" in details to block early changes through Appointment Accelerator.

#### FAQs

1. **Dilation**
   * Comprehensive & routine exams usually **require dilation**.
   * **Script**: "As part of the exam, your eyes will be dilated, leading to blurry vision and light sensitivity for a few hours. We suggest having someone drive you home."
   * Inform patient about likely dilation. _(See_ [_Dilation Key_](./#dilation-key) _for standard scripting)_
2. **Exam Duration**
   * Comprehensive exams generally last **90â€“120 minutes**.
   * **Script**: "Because of the complexity and diagnostic testing, we usually need about 90 minutes. This ensures thorough care."
3. **Self-Pay Pricing**  
   a. The self-pay price for a comprehensive exam is typically **$150-$250**.  
   b. **Script:** "The estimated costs for an exam can range between $150-$250. Once you have checked out, our check-out staff will provide your final self-pay costs. All costs are due at the time of the appointment."
4. **Important Reminders**   
   a. Patients are typically only eligible through their vision plan once per year. If a routine exam is being scheduled before the 1-year eligibility timeframe, the patient may need to use their medical insurance instead.  
   b. Always schedule patients with both vision and medical insurance info.


#### Closing Reminders

Follow the [Standard Closing Procedures](./#standard-closing-procedures-scripting) with these specific additions:

* **Routine vs. Medical Coverage Notice**: Include the routine vs. medical coverage script for routine eye exams
* **Dilation Requirements**: Inform patient about likely dilation and 90-120 minute duration
* If location differs from usual, emphasize the change

### Scheduling Established Patients

#### Providers

Appointments will typically be scheduled with the patient's existing provider unless the patient requests a change.

* If the provider's schedule is more than 10 days out, the patient can be placed on the waitlist to be contacted if an appointment opens sooner.
* **CFS / SFEC / LEA**: Do not schedule more than **two family members** in one day **per provider**.

#### Process

1. **Verify Patient Information**
   * In NextGen, go to the **Patient Information** tab. Verify and update demographics and insurance as needed.
   * Review the **Insurance Guide** to confirm we accept the patient's plan.
   * Ask if the patient has any issues needing immediate attention (see **Triage Protocol**).
2. **Check for Recalls / Follow-up**
   * Click the **Recall icon** in NextGen's Patient Information bar to see active recalls (location, provider, event).
   * If there are no active recalls, check the patient's **IntelleChartPRO Encounter Summary**. Look in the **Follow-Up** section of the most recent visit(s) for next recommended appointment details.
3. **Schedule the Appointment**
   * Return to NextGen and click **Appointment Search Ahead** in the Patient Information bar.
   * If the patient needs **multiple appointments** the same day (e.g., Visual Field + Comprehensive Exam), schedule from the **Appointment Book**:
     * Visual Field in the testing resource, then the Comprehensive Exam in the provider's resource 15-45 minutes later.
   * Complete the **Appointment Search** process and book the slot.
   * If the provider noted in ICP that the patient is due for a **Compâ€“Est Adult** or **Compâ€“Est Child**, check the patient's insurance. If it's medical, schedule as **Compâ€“Medical**, or if it's vision, schedule as **Routine Employee** or **Routine Vision Exam**.
4. **Referrals / Insurance Requirements**
   * If the patient's insurance or HMO requires a referral/prior authorization, add **"Do Not Move" (DNM)** in the appointment details. This ensures the slot is not moved to an earlier date without the referral in place.
5. **Potential Dilation**
   * Some appointments may require dilation. (See [**Dilation Key**](<Dilation Key.md>) for more details.)
   * **Suggested Script**:\
     "As part of the examination process, your eyes may be dilated to allow a thorough assessment of your eye health. Due to the dilation, your vision may be blurry and light-sensitive for several hours. For your safety and comfort, we recommend you bring someone who can drive you home afterward."

### Handling Insurance Information During Scheduling

#### Overview

When a patient contacts the office to schedule any appointment, staff must:

1. Confirm the patient's **demographic and insurance** information.
2. Verify the **plan name** and **policy number** to ensure the insurance on file is active.
3. **Arrange** insurance policies in the correct order in NextGen:
   1. **Primary** Medical Insurance
   2. **Secondary** Medical Insurance
   3. **Tertiary** Medical Insurance
   4. **Vision** Insurance

> **Note:** Vision plans **cannot** be used for medical exams (cataract, cornea, glaucoma, LASIK consultations).

If the patient has **no medical insurance**, set them as **Self-Pay â€“ No Insurance**.

Use the **US Eye Insurance Guide** to confirm whether the plan is in-network, out-of-network, or non-participating.

#### Collecting & Entering Insurance

**1. Verify Information**

* **Questions**:
  1. "What is the plan name on your insurance card?"
  2. "Is this a **Commercial, Medicare, or Medicaid** plan?"
     * **Note**: Supplement/Medigap can **only** be secondary.
  3. "Does your insurance card say **PPO** or **HMO**?"

> **If the patient cannot provide accurate insurance info**, inform them that you **cannot schedule** until you have their plan details. Offer to wait while they retrieve the cards or to have them call back.

**2. Insurance Guide Check**

1. **Confirm** whether the practice participates with the plan (in-network vs. out-of-network vs. non-participating).
2. If **in-network** and no additional action is needed, **enter** the plan in NextGen and continue scheduling.
3. If **in-network** but requires a **referral**, schedule the patient **7â€“14 days** out to allow time for referral.
   * For emergent appointments, inform the patient that if the referral is not received in time, they will be **self-pay** at time of service.
   * If patient agrees to proceed, enter **Self-Pay â€“ Do Not Bill Medical Ins** in the policy number field (e.g., "ER APPT"), with effective and expiration date set to the day of service.
   * Email **Insurance Verification** to notify them of the urgent need for a referral (include plan name, policy #, patient details, date).
4. If **VA (Optum)** coverage:
   * **VA must schedule** the appointment directly (patient cannot self-schedule).
   * Check the **Authorization** tab in Insurance Maintenance for an existing authorization.
   * If no authorization, let the patient know the VA needs to send a new one.
5. If the patient's plan is **non-participating** review the [Insurance Guide By Provider](Insurance_Guide_By_Provider.md) to determine if the plan is non-participating with out-of-network benefits or non-participating without out-of-network benefits.
   * Enter as **Self-Pay â€“ No Insurance**, **Self-Pay â€“ Non Par With Ins**, or **Self-Pay â€“ Do Not Bill Medical Ins**, as appropriate.
   * Non-PAR with out-of-network benefits: Inform the patient XX Name is non-participating, but their insurance plan has out-of-network benefits. Costs may be higher with out-of-network benefits.

**3. Ask About Secondary Insurance**

1. Collect the **secondary plan** name, plan type (Commercial/Medicare/Medicaid), and "PPO" or "HMO" status.
2. Check the **US Eye Insurance Guide** for participation status.
   * If **in-network** for secondary, enter it in PM and finalize scheduling.
   * If **out-of-network**:
     * Inform patient their copay/out-of-pocket may be higher.
     * Note in appointment details: "Patient made aware on \[date] we are OON with higher OOP costs."
   * If **no OON** benefits:
     * Patient must proceed as self-pay. Load their insurance as **Self Pay â€“ Non Par With Ins** and enter the plan name in the Policy Number field.

**4. Deactivating Old Plans**

* If you added a **new insurance** to an existing chart, check whether any prior plans are now inactive.
* If so, add an **expiration date** and remove the **Active** marker. (See _NG PM â€“ Deactivate an Insurance_.)

#### Sample Scripting

> **Confirming Information**:\
> "Can you please confirm your full name, date of birth, insurance plan, and insurance ID number so I can verify we have the most updated billing information on file?"

> **Patient Only Has Vision Plan**:\
> "Please note that vision plans cannot be used for medical exams such as cataracts, cornea, glaucoma, retina specialist, or LASIK consultations."

> **Cannot Provide Insurance**:\
> "In order to proceed with scheduling, it's important we have accurate insurance info to ensure coverage. If you cannot provide it now, please call back when you have it so we can schedule your appointment."

> **Emergent Appointment, Referral Required**:\
> "Your insurance plan needs a referral from your PCP. We will request an urgent referral, but if it isn't received before your appointment, you'll be considered self-pay at time of service. All fees will be due at check-in. Would you like to proceed?"

> **Non-Participating Insurance**:\
> "We are not in-network for your plan. You can still be seen on a self-pay basis. All payments are due at time of service."

### Scheduling Cataract

#### Cataract Overview

**What is a Cataract?**

A cataract occurs when the natural lens becomes cloudy with age, leading to blurred vision, glare, difficulty driving at night, and possible blindness.

**Cataract Surgery**

Cataract surgery removes the natural lens and replaces it with an intraocular lens (IOL). Femtosecond laser technology may be used to enhance precision and consistency if the surgeon determines the patient is a candidate.

**Vision Options**

US Eye offers **Light Adjustable Lens**, **Advanced**, **Custom**, and **Basic** vision correction options. Surgeons may use a combination of technologies and lens implants. These are the same options used for Clear Lens Enhancement / Refractive Lens Exchange (see [Scheduling Refractive](./#scheduling-refractive))

#### Important Reminders

* Make certain every appointment is scheduled in **time order.**
* If the appointment is **>10 days out**, offer to add patient to waitlist (in addition to scheduling).
* Consultations are valid for **3 months**.
* Surgery measurements (biometry/AVT) are valid for **6 months**.
* **Vision plans cannot be used** for cataract consults.
* Self-pay = **Refractive consult**

#### Process

**If Patient Has Referral**

**Criteria:**

* Diagnosed cataracts ready for removal
* Complaints of blurry vision, glare, or night driving difficulty

**Instructions:**

1. Schedule with preferred provider.
2. If no preferred provider, schedule with first available in patient's preferred location.
3. Note contact lens status and discontinuation timing in appointment details (see chart below).

**If Patient Does NOT Have Referral**

1. Check Phreesia or ICP for documentation.
2. Ask about last eye exam. If >1 year ago, follow **Primary Eye Care Protocol**.
3. Request fax of last eye exam if diagnosis is unclear.
4. If exam is vague, send ICP communication to the provider team to confirm readiness.
5. Document **records status** in "Physician Relations / Records."
6. Enter surgeon's name in **Referring Physician** field (never leave blank)._(Follow standard_ [_Referral Management Protocol_](./#referral-management-protocol)_)_

**Additional Criteria for Patients WITHOUT Referral:**

* Before scheduling a Cataract Consult for a self-referral, confirm they meet typical criteria (e.g., age > 55, experiencing symptoms like blurry vision, glare, night driving difficulty).
* If unsure based on patient description or if last exam was >1 year ago, consider scheduling for [Primary Eye Care](./#scheduling-primary-eye-care) first, or request records per the protocol.
* If patient insists on Cataract consult despite lack of clear diagnosis/recent exam, document this clearly.

* **Common Conditions and Procedures**
  * Keratoconus (that could require corneal crosslinking or CTAK)
  * Fuchs' Dystrophy or corneal edema (that could require corneal transplantion such as DMEK)
  * Pterygium or Pinguecula (that could require excision and graft placement)
  * Prior surgical complications or trauma to front of the eye (that could require complex anterior segment surgery, IOL exchange, secondary lens placement, or iris repair â€” **Dr. Elizabeth Davis** only)
  * Severe dry eye and ocular surface disease (must be referred by an optometrist; that could require dry eye treatments as explained below)

_**Important Reminder:** The patientâ€™s insurance company is the only entity that can provide accurate and up-to-date information about their policy, coverage, or costs. Since the insurance company writes and manages the patientâ€™s policy, they have access to all the necessary details and are best positioned to answer questions. Please do not send these types of inquiries to RCM, instead put it back on the patient to reach out to their insurance company._

### ICP Patient Tasks Related to Clinical Questions / Medication Refills / DMV Forms

Certain requests **only** clinical staff or providers can handle. Refer to the table below to know how to notify the correct group in ICP (IntelleChartPRO). Clinical staff monitor ICP tasks throughout the day and aim to respond within the same day if received in the morning or by the next day if received in the afternoon.

**Important Notes**

* **Do Not** send ICP communications to groups prefixed with `zzz` (inactive).
* **Do Not** send ICP communications to individual people.
* If a provider no longer works here and the patient hasn't established care with another provider, send the message to the [**Patient Care Team by region** ](<Provider Reference Guide.md>)(Florida)
* Patients should be informed that the request is typically handled within **24â€“48 hours**.
* Make certain all information discussed on the call is included in the **ICP** message.
* **New Patients:** If they have clinical or medication questions, they must be scheduled for an appointment. Clinical staff cannot advise or fill out forms (DMV, tint, medical forms) without a prior exam.
