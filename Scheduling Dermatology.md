## Important Reminders

- **AMARA:** Transfer all calls about AMARA scheduling to the AMARA quick connect.
- If you offer an appointment more than 10 days away, you **must** offer to place the patient on the **waitlist**.
- If Dr. Newman is out of the office or booking too far out, offer the patient an appointment with Shannon Bednarz for the same services (excluding Mohs).
- When Dr. Newman is out, one of his team is still available for **tech-only visits** (e.g., suture removals).
- **Laser – KTP** treatments are performed by **Shannon Bednarz** at the AMARA location.

## Process

### If Patient Has Referral
1. Check **Phreesia** and/or **ICP Documents** for the referral.
2. If the referral document is missing, alert the patient to have it sent over before the consultation.
3. Schedule with the referring provider named on the referral.

### If Patient Does **Not** Have Referral
1. If the patient was seen internally, check **ICP** for any note about a dermatology referral.  
2. In the **appointment details**, include the reason for the consultation.  
3. Enter the provider's name in the **Referring Physician** field to indicate self-referral (field should never be blank).

## Surgical / Clinical Requests

For any surgical or clinical requests, **email**:  
[derm@centerforsight.net](mailto:derm@centerforsight.net)

Include the patient's:
- Name
- Date of Birth
- Preferred phone number

**Emergency visits** (e.g., post-surgical complications like bleeding, uncontrolled pain, infection, severe rash) are handled by the clinic.  
- In these cases, email the details (patient name, chart number, phone numbers, and symptoms).

**ED&C, MOHS, and other surgical appointments** are performed in-office, not at a surgery center.  
- These appointments are scheduled, rescheduled, and canceled by the **clinical team**.

**Tech-Only Visits** (e.g., suture removals): Must be scheduled within the time frame set by clinical staff. If the patient needs to reschedule, send an email.

**Cancellation List**: For patients wanting a sooner appointment, also email the details (patient name, chart number, phone numbers, reason for earlier appointment).

## Closing Reminders

1. Ask if there is anything else you can assist the patient with.  
2. Encourage the patient to complete their **pre-visit workflow** (Phreesia) about 5 days prior.  
   > "Five days prior to your appointment, you will receive a message from Phreesia, our registration platform. We kindly ask that you confirm your appointment and complete the registration process before your appointment date. This helps expedite check-in and allows us to spend more time on your care. If you have any issues with registration, please contact us."  
3. Thank the patient and confirm the **date/time/location**. If it differs from their usual location, reiterate that.  
4. **Example**:  
   "Thank you [Mr./Ms. Patient Last Name], we look forward to seeing you for your dermatology consultation on [date] at [time] at our [office] location."
