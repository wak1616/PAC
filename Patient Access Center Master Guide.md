# Provider, Location, and Dilation Guides

## Provider Reference

*This section contains detailed information about all providers across the organization. For the complete provider reference guide with specialties, patient types, office locations, and NPIs, please refer to the [Provider Reference Guide document](Provider%20Reference%20Guide.md).*

## Location Reference

*This section contains detailed information about all locations. For the complete location reference guide with addresses, phone numbers, and hours, please refer to the [Location Reference Guide document](Location%20Reference%20Guide.md).*

## Dilation Reference

*For a detailed list of dilated vs. non-dilated appointments and relevant patient scripting, please refer to the [Dilation Key document](Dilation%20Key.md).*

# Referral Management Protocol

This protocol outlines the standard steps when scheduling patients who may or may not have a formal referral for specialty services (e.g., Cornea, Cataract, Dermatology, Glaucoma, Oculoplastics Medical, Refractive, Retina).

## If Patient Has Referral

1.  **Verify Referral:** Check **Phreesia** and/or **ICP Documents** to confirm the referral exists and is for the appropriate specialty consultation.
2.  **Obtain Missing Referral:** If the referral document is not found, **alert the patient** that it needs to be sent over by the referring office *before* the consultation appointment. The appointment may need rescheduling if the referral is not received.
3.  **Schedule:** Schedule the appointment with the provider named on the referral, if specified. If no provider is specified, schedule with the first available appropriate specialist at the patient's preferred location.
4.  **Document:** Note the referral source and status in the appropriate appointment details field (e.g., Physician Relations / Records in NextGen).

## If Patient Does NOT Have Referral (Self-Referral)

1.  **Confirm Condition:** Ask the patient about their symptoms or reason for seeking a specialty consultation. Confirm if they have been diagnosed with a relevant condition by a previous eye care provider (internal or external).
    - If the patient was seen internally, check **ICP** for notes indicating a diagnosis or recommendation for a specialty consult.
    - If the reason is unclear or seems more appropriate for Primary Eye Care (e.g., needs glasses update, no specific diagnosis), follow the [Scheduling Primary Eye Care](#scheduling-primary-eye-care) protocol first.
2.  **Records Requirement:** Alert the patient that **medical records** from their previous eye exam(s) related to the condition **are required** for the specialist consultation. Explain that the appointment may be canceled or rescheduled if records are not received beforehand.
3.  **Schedule Out & Mark:** Schedule the appointment at least **1 week out** to allow time for records to be sent and reviewed. Mark **"DNM" (Do Not Move)** in the appointment details to prevent automated systems from moving the appointment earlier.
4.  **Document Records Status:** Document the records request status (e.g., "Records requested from Dr. Smith on [date]", "Patient to bring records") in the Physician Relations / Records field or appointment notes.
5.  **Provider Selection:** If the patient has no surgeon/specialist preference, offer the next available appointment with an appropriate specialist at the requested/most convenient location.
6.  **Referring Physician Field:** Enter the **specialist's name** being scheduled in the *Referring Physician* field in NextGen to indicate it's a self-referral handled internally. **This field should never be left blank.**

# Emergency Triage Protocol

## Scope

This protocol details the steps taken to properly triage and schedule a patient with an acute issue.

---

## Surgical Check (Last 30 Days)

Before using the triage protocol, **ask if the patient had surgery in the last 30 days**:

- If **yes**, and they are an established patient who was referred to a surgeon by one of our providers:
  - They **must** be scheduled for a **same-day** appointment.
  - If no same-day slot is available, triage via **ICP** message to the **Patient Care Team**, mark it **URGENT**.
  - If the patient is **comanaged**, they should see their comanaging physician. If the patient requests a different provider, note it in the appointment details.

---

## Special Cases

- **ASC concerns**:
  - **Sarasota*: [SRQ-ASCinquiries@useye.com](mailto:SRQ-ASCinquiries@useye.com)
  - **Naples**: [Naples-ASCinquiries@useye.com](mailto:Naples-ASCinquiries@useye.com)
  - **Santa Fe (LEA)**: [santafeasc@useye.com](mailto:santafeasc@useye.com)
  - Refer to "Handling Patient Questions & Requests Protocol" for further instructions.
- **Dermatology concerns**: email [Derm@centerforsight.net](mailto:Derm@centerforsight.net) with the patient's name, DOB, phone number, and symptoms.

---

## Identify Urgency & Scheduling Process

1. Ask about the **symptoms**.
2. Ask about the **duration** of these symptoms.
3. **Determine the urgency** (Emergency, Urgent, or Non-Urgent) via the table below.
4. Document all symptoms, which eye(s) they affect, and how long they've been present.

---

## Emergency – Same Day (See ASAP)

- **New Patient**: Schedule with an **OD**.
- **Established Patient**: Schedule with their **primary provider**.
- If they are in a **post-op period** and **comanaged**, they should see their comanaging provider.

**Process**

- PAC schedules the **first available** opening (same day).
- If no ER or short appointment slot is open, you may schedule in any open space (excluding lunch hour).
- **If** no same day spots are available for that provider, send an **ICP** communication to the Patient Care Team of that region and mark **urgent**.
- **Dr. Banker** (CFS): Triaged by an **OD first** for emergency appts. For retina emergency referrals (e.g. detachment or tear), send an ICP message to Dr. Banker's team marked **urgent**. **Do not schedule**.
- If it's **3:30 PM–5:00 PM**:
  - Attempt a warm transfer to the office.
  - If the office is unavailable, enter an **ICP** message to the Patient Care Team. The office will contact the patient directly to schedule.
- If uncertain or unable to schedule, **notify** the Patient Care Team in ICP (if new patient, see "ICP IntelleChart – New Patient Task" below).

---

### Urgent – 24–48 Hours

- **New Patient**: Schedule with **OD**.
- **Established Patient**: Schedule with **primary provider**.
- If in post-op/comanaged, see their comanaging provider if possible.

**Process**

- Schedule in the first available **orange ER spot** first.
- If unavailable orange ER spots, schedule for any 30 minute (long) spot that that provider has in next 48 hours.
- If unsure where to schedule, send **ICP** triage communication to the Patient Care Team in that region and mark **urgent**.

---

### Non-Urgent – Next Available

- **New Patient**: Schedule with **OD**.
- **Established Patient**: Schedule with **primary provider**. For more information about scheduling non-urgent established patients, see "Scheduling Established Patients".
- For post-op/comanaged, normal scheduling unless otherwise indicated.

**Process**

- Schedule the patient in the next available spot (within 2 weeks).
- If unsure or no spots are available, triage via ICP to the Patient Care Team in that region.

### Scheduling Instructions by Urgency

[Content repeated above – may remove if redundant.]

---

### ICP Triage Messages

If you need to **triage via ICP** instead of scheduling immediately, see the table for **notify** field groups:

- `*CFS North Region Patient Care Team`
- `*CFS Mid Region Patient Care Team`
- `*CFS South Region Patient Care Team`
- `*SFEC Patient Care Team`
- `*LEA Patient Care Team`
- `*RHC Patient Care Team`

**Add the provider's name at the beginning of the message** if known.  
Use **clear, concise language**—avoid abbreviations. Document eye(s) affected, symptom details, cause if known, and duration. Include the patient's preferred location and best callback number.  
Inform the patient that staff will call them to discuss their symptoms and urgency.

---

### ICP IntelleChart – New Patient Task

1. For a **new patient**, follow **NextGen Transfer to ICP** before creating an ICP task.
2. Create an ICP task:
   - **Notify →** "Practice Patient Care Team"
   - Mark **URGENT** if needed.
3. If the system doesn't show the user's initials in the ICP task, it means the patient is not linked to a practice.
   - In that case, schedule an appointment under **ICP resource** using the **Transfer to ICP** event to link them.

---

### Additional Reminders

1. If symptoms worsen before the scheduled appointment, advise the patient to **call back** immediately.
2. Explain to the patient that he/she will likely be dilated for an Emergency visit.
3. If the patient isn't being seen the same day but has any of the following, they'll be **dilated** at the visit:
   - Blurred Vision
   - Decrease in Vision
   - Double Vision
   - NEW Floaters
   - Curtain, Veil, or Spider webs

# Contact Lens Discontinuation for Consultations

Cataract and Refractive surgery evaluations (as well as Cornea - Keratoconus evaluations) require patients to stop wearing contact lenses for a period beforehand to ensure accurate corneal measurements.

## Script Prompt
> "Wearing contact lenses can temporarily change the shape of your cornea. To ensure the most accurate measurements for your upcoming consultation [or potential surgery], it's essential that you stop wearing your contact lenses for a specific period before your appointment. What type of contact lenses do you currently wear?"

*(After determining the type, provide the relevant discontinuation period from the table below and document this instruction in the appointment details.)*

## Discontinuation Periods

| Lens Type                      | Florida            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Soft Daily/Extended Wear       | 1 Week             |
| Toric Daily Wear               | 2 Weeks            |
| Hard / RGP / PMMA              | 3 Weeks            |
| Scleral (for Keratoconus only) | Do NOT Discontinue |

> **Note:** Add **"DNM"** to the appointment details for patients requiring discontinuation to prevent Appointment Accelerator from offering earlier slots before the discontinuation period is met.

## Scleral Lens Note
> **Reminder for Scleral Lens Wearers:** Patients wearing scleral lenses should **bring their lens case and solution** to their consultation, as they will likely be asked to remove them during the exam. *(Confirm specific instructions if unsure for non-Keratoconus Scleral wearers or other complex cases).*

---

# 72-Hour Scheduling Rule

## When to Use
Use this rule to override standard appointment templates if a patient needs to be scheduled within 72 hours from the call time (such as emergency cases).

## Dilation and Exam Duration (inform patient clearly)

> "Your eyes will be dilated, causing blurry vision and light sensitivity for several hours. Please arrange transportation home."

> "Dilation can only be waived by a Physician."

> "Your exam may last approximately 90-120 minutes if a comprehensive exam is needed."

## Required Documentation

- Note “72-hour rule” clearly in appointment details.
- Extend appointment from 15 to 30 min when combining short slots.

## Important Reminders

- Patients are typically only eligible through their vision plan once per year. If a routine exam is being scheduled before the 1-year eligibility timeframe, the patient may need to use their medical insurance instead.
- Always schedule patients with both vision and medical insurance info.

## If Additional Requirements are Needed by Insurance

- If referral is required but not obtained, inform patient of self-pay requirement:

> "Your insurance requires a referral from your Primary Care Provider (PCP). It usually takes about seven business days. Without this referral, you can be seen as self-pay. You’ll sign a Self-Pay form, and fees will be due at visit."

- Document PCP information clearly in the patient’s chart and appointment notes.
- Note in the appointment details: “Pt is aware PCP referral is required; self-pay if not received.”
- This also applies to Optum VA insurance patients if the authorization on file does not match the specific doctor being scheduled under the 72-hour rule. Inform the patient:

> "The current Optum VA authorization is for Dr. `{{current_provider_name}}`.
> If you are requesting a new appointment with a different provider, we must submit a request for additional services.
> This process can take up to seven (7) days to receive VA approval.
> If there is no VA authorization on file, you have the option to bill your medical insurance instead."

## Closing Scripting

- Confirm appointment details: date, time, and location.
- Inform patient about pre-visit registration via Phreesia:

> "You may receive a Phreesia registration message. Please complete this in advance to streamline your check-in. Contact us if you have questions."

- Final confirmation:

> "Thank you, [Mr./Ms. Patient Last Name]. Can we assist you with anything else? We look forward to seeing you on [date] at [time] at our [location] office."

# Scheduling Guidelines

## Scheduling Primary Eye Care

### Overview of Comprehensive Exams

A comprehensive exam typically includes:
- Visual acuity  
- Eye coordination  
- Refraction  
- Evaluation of the eye structures  

These exams are usually performed annually and help maintain overall eye health.

### Providers

> **\*** = Provider only sees established patients.

#### By Location

| Location | MD/DO Providers | OD Providers |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| **CFS**  | Dr. Jon Berlie<br>Dr. George Brinnig<br>Dr. Julie Carter | Dr. Len Brown<br>Dr. Daniel Hadland<br>Dr. Melissa Hammond<br>Dr. Erin Hardie<br>Dr. George Hurwitz<br>Dr. Todd Lang<br>Dr. James Lenhart<br>Dr. Lori Long<br>Dr. Michael Maloney<br>Dr. Mary McVey<br>Dr. David Mertzlufft<br>Dr. Bradley Middaugh<br>Dr. Patrick Nelson<br>Dr. Logan Page<br>Dr. Charles Putrino<br>Dr. Rachel Randolph<br>Dr. Kyle Schaub<br>Dr. Joseph Sowka<br>Dr. Scott Stevens<br>Dr. Lori Vollmer<br>Dr. Trisha Werner |
| **LEA**  | Dr. Jose Vazquez | Dr. Christine Bui<br>Dr. Mari Holderby<br>Dr. Alexandria Rawls |
| **RHC**  | *(None listed)* | *(None listed)* |
| **SFEC** | Dr. Albert Smolyar | Dr. Sarah Johnson<br>Dr. Brian Marhue<br>Dr. Penny Orr<br>Dr. Hunter Vittone |

### Important Reminders

1. **Refraction rechecks** should always be scheduled with the **same provider** who performed the comprehensive exam. Patients should consult an optician first to check their glasses before scheduling a refraction recheck.  
2. If a patient **hasn't been seen in 3+ months**, a **comprehensive exam** is scheduled, **not** just a refraction.  
3. **CFS/SFEC/LEA**: Do not schedule more than **two family members** in one day **per provider**.  
4. If you offer an appointment more than **10 days out**, you **must** offer to place the patient on the **waitlist**.

### Process

1. **OD vs. MD/DO**  
   - **Optometrists (OD)** can treat, diagnose, and prescribe for most eye conditions. If surgery is needed, the OD will refer to a Surgeon.

2. **New vs. Established**  
   - If it's been **more than three years** since the patient's last exam, schedule them using the appropriate **new patient** event.  
   - For **Routine Employee** exams, see the **Employee Exams Protocol**.  
   - **Vision plans** can only be used for **Routine Vision** exams. Check insurance acceptance, and ensure both medical + vision are listed in NextGen.

3. **Contact Lens (CL) Fittings**  
   - **Established** patient with a CL fitting:
     - If not seen in **over one year**, schedule a **Comprehensive Exam** and note "CL" in details. The provider decides if the fitting can occur then or needs a separate visit.  
   - Confirm **type of lenses** in the appointment details, and ensure you schedule with a provider who fits that lens.  
   - Patients must **wear** their contact lenses to the appointment and **bring** their lens prescription/info.  
   - **New patients** cannot be scheduled directly for a Contact Lens Fitting. Schedule a **Comp Medical or Routine Vision** as a new patient exam instead. The provider will decide if the fitting can occur or if a separate appointment is required.  
   - If externally referred for **specialty contact lens** (e.g., scleral), schedule at least **one week** out and use "DNM" in details to block early changes through Appointment Accelerator.

### FAQs

1. **Dilation**  
   - Comprehensive & routine exams usually **require dilation**.  
   - **Script**: "As part of the exam, your eyes will be dilated, leading to blurry vision and light sensitivity for a few hours. We suggest having someone drive you home."
   - Inform patient about likely dilation. *(See [Dilation Key](#dilation-key) for standard scripting)*

2. **Exam Duration**  
   - Comprehensive exams generally last **90–120 minutes**.  
   - **Script**: "Because of the complexity and diagnostic testing, we usually need about 90 minutes. This ensures thorough care."

### Closing Reminders

1. Ask if there's anything else the patient needs.  
2. **Routine vs. Medical** Coverage Note:  
   > "Your routine eye exam is on [date/time]. If a medical condition is found, the physician will let you know about any insurance or financial responsibilities before proceeding with treatment that day. You can choose to proceed immediately or schedule the care for another time."  
3. Encourage completing the **Phreesia** pre-visit workflow ~5 days before the appointment.  
4. Thank the patient and confirm date/time/location. If different from their usual location, **emphasize** the change.  
   - **Suggested**: "Thank you [Mr./Ms. Patient Last Name]. We look forward to seeing you for your comprehensive eye exam on [date] at [time] at our [office] location."
*(Follow [Standard Closing Procedures](#standard-closing-procedures))*

## Scheduling Established Patients

### Providers

Appointments will typically be scheduled with the patient's existing provider unless the patient requests a change.  
- If the provider's schedule is more than 10 days out, the patient can be placed on the waitlist to be contacted if an appointment opens sooner.  
- **CFS / SFEC / LEA**: Do not schedule more than **two family members** in one day **per provider**.

### Process

1. **Verify Patient Information**  
   - In NextGen, go to the **Patient Information** tab. Verify and update demographics and insurance as needed.  
   - Review the **Insurance Guide** to confirm we accept the patient's plan.  
   - Ask if the patient has any issues needing immediate attention (see **Triage Protocol**).

2. **Check for Recalls / Follow-up**  
   - Click the **Recall icon** in NextGen's Patient Information bar to see active recalls (location, provider, event).  
   - If there are no active recalls, check the patient's **IntelleChartPRO Encounter Summary**. Look in the **Follow-Up** section of the most recent visit(s) for next recommended appointment details.

3. **Schedule the Appointment**  
   - Return to NextGen and click **Appointment Search Ahead** in the Patient Information bar.  
   - If the patient needs **multiple appointments** the same day (e.g., Visual Field + Comprehensive Exam), schedule from the **Appointment Book**:
     - Visual Field in the testing resource, then the Comprehensive Exam in the provider's resource 15-45 minutes later.
   - Complete the **Appointment Search** process and book the slot.  
   - If the provider noted in ICP that the patient is due for a **Comp–Est Adult** or **Comp–Est Child**, check the patient's insurance. If it's medical, schedule as **Comp–Medical** (or **Comp–Medicaid**), or if it's vision, schedule as **Routine Employee** or **Routine Vision Exam**.

4. **Referrals / Insurance Requirements**  
   - If the patient's insurance or HMO requires a referral/prior authorization, add **"Do Not Move" (DNM)** in the appointment details. This ensures the slot is not moved to an earlier date without the referral in place.

5. **Potential Dilation**  
   - Some appointments may require dilation. (See **Dilation Key** for more details.)  
   - **Suggested Script**:  
     "As part of the examination process, your eyes may be dilated to allow a thorough assessment of your eye health. Due to the dilation, your vision may be blurry and light-sensitive for several hours. For your safety and comfort, we recommend you bring someone who can drive you home afterward."

### Closing Reminders

1. **Ask if any further assistance is needed**  
   - Example: "Is there anything else I can help you with today?"

2. **Routine vs. Medical Coverage Notice**  
   - **Script**:  
     "Your appointment for a routine eye exam is scheduled for [date] at [time]. Should the physician identify a medical condition during your visit, we will give you updated insurance/financial information before proceeding. You can decide whether to address the medical condition then or schedule for a later time."

3. **Encourage Pre-Visit Workflow**  
   - **Script**:  
     "Five days before your appointment, you'll receive a message from Phreesia to confirm and complete registration. This helps speed up check-in and lets us focus on your care. If you have any trouble with registration, please let us know."

4. **Confirm Appointment Details**  
   - Thank the patient, confirm date/time/location.  
   - If the location differs from the patient's usual site, emphasize that change.  
   - **Suggested**:  
     "Thank you, [Mr./Ms. Patient Last Name]. We look forward to seeing you for your appointment on [date] at [time] at our [office] location."
*(Follow [Standard Closing Procedures](#standard-closing-procedures))*

## Handling Insurance Information During Scheduling

### Overview

When a patient contacts the office to schedule any appointment, staff must:
1. Confirm the patient's **demographic and insurance** information.
2. Verify the **plan name** and **policy number** to ensure the insurance on file is active.
3. **Arrange** insurance policies in the correct order in NextGen:
   1. **Primary** Medical Insurance
   2. **Secondary** Medical Insurance
   3. **Tertiary** Medical Insurance
   4. **Vision** Insurance

> **Note:** Vision plans **cannot** be used for medical exams (cataract, cornea, glaucoma, LASIK consultations).

If the patient has **no medical insurance**, set them as **Self-Pay – No Insurance**.

Use the **US Eye Insurance Guide** to confirm whether the plan is in-network, out-of-network, or non-participating.

### Collecting & Entering Insurance

#### 1. Verify Information
- Ask if the patient has their **primary insurance card** available.
- **Questions**:
  1. "What is the plan name on your insurance card?"
  2. "Is this a **Commercial, Medicare, or Medicaid** plan?"
     - **Note**: Supplement/Medigap can **only** be secondary.
  3. "Does your insurance card say **PPO** or **HMO**?"

> **If the patient cannot provide accurate insurance info**, inform them that you **cannot schedule** until you have their plan details. Offer to wait while they retrieve the cards or to have them call back.

#### 2. Insurance Guide Check
1. **Confirm** whether the practice participates with the plan (in-network vs. out-of-network vs. non-participating).
2. If **in-network** and no additional action is needed, **enter** the plan in NextGen and continue scheduling.
3. If **in-network** but requires a **referral**, schedule the patient **7–14 days** out to allow time for referral.
   - For emergent appointments, inform the patient that if the referral is not received in time, they will be **self-pay** at time of service.
   - If patient agrees to proceed, enter **Self-Pay – Do Not Bill Medical Ins** in the policy number field (e.g., "ER APPT"), with effective and expiration date set to the day of service.
   - Email **Insurance Verification** to notify them of the urgent need for a referral (include plan name, policy #, patient details, date).

4. If **VA (Optum)** coverage:
   - **VA must schedule** the appointment directly (patient cannot self-schedule).
   - Check the **Authorization** tab in Insurance Maintenance for an existing authorization.
   - If no authorization, let the patient know the VA needs to send a new one.

5. If the patient's plan is **non-participating** (or the patient does not want to use insurance), explain they will be **self-pay**:
   - A **self-pay deposit** is collected at check-in, additional costs at check-out.
   - Enter as **Self-Pay – No Insurance**, **Self-Pay – Non Par With Ins**, or **Self-Pay – Do Not Bill Medical Ins**, as appropriate.
   - See *RCM Procedure Manual Self-Pay Deposit Collection* for pricing estimates.

#### 3. Ask About Secondary Insurance
1. Collect the **secondary plan** name, plan type (Commercial/Medicare/Medicaid), and "PPO" or "HMO" status.
2. Check the **US Eye Insurance Guide** for participation status.
   - If **in-network** for secondary, enter it in PM and finalize scheduling.
   - If **out-of-network**:
     - Inform patient their copay/out-of-pocket may be higher.  
     - Note in appointment details: "Patient made aware on [date] we are OON with higher OOP costs."
   - If **no OON** benefits:
     - Patient must proceed as self-pay. Load their insurance as **Self Pay – Non Par With Ins** and enter the plan name in the Policy Number field.

#### 4. Deactivating Old Plans
- If you added a **new insurance** to an existing chart, check whether any prior plans are now inactive.
- If so, add an **expiration date** and remove the **Active** marker. (See *NG PM – Deactivate an Insurance*.)

### Sample Scripting

> **Confirming Information**:  
> "Can you please confirm your full name, date of birth, insurance plan, and insurance ID number so I can verify we have the most updated billing information on file?"

> **Patient Only Has Vision Plan**:  
> "Please note that vision plans cannot be used for medical exams such as cataracts, cornea, glaucoma, or LASIK consultations."

> **Cannot Provide Insurance**:  
> "In order to proceed with scheduling, it's important we have accurate insurance info to ensure coverage. If you cannot provide it now, please call back when you have it so we can schedule your appointment."

> **Emergent Appointment, Referral Required**:  
> "Your insurance plan needs a referral from your PCP. We will request an urgent referral, but if it isn't received before your appointment, you'll be considered self-pay at time of service. All fees will be due at check-in. Would you like to proceed?"

> **Non-Participating Insurance**:  
> "We are not in-network for your plan. You can still be seen on a self-pay basis. All payments are due at time of service."

## Scheduling Cataract

### Cataract Overview

#### What is a Cataract?

A cataract occurs when the natural lens becomes cloudy with age, leading to blurred vision, glare, difficulty driving at night, and possible blindness.

#### Cataract Surgery

Cataract surgery removes the natural lens and replaces it with an intraocular lens (IOL). Femtosecond laser technology may be used to enhance precision and consistency if the surgeon determines the patient is a candidate.

#### Vision Options

US Eye offers **Light Adjustable Lens**, **Advanced**, **Custom**, and **Basic** vision correction options. Surgeons may use a combination of technologies and lens implants.  These are the same options used for Clear Lens Enhancement / Refractive Lens Exchange (see [Scheduling Refractive](#scheduling-refractive))

### Providers

#### Locations & Providers

| Location | Providers |
| -------- | --------- |
| **CFS**  | Dr. Jon Berlie, Dr. George Brinnig, Dr. Joaquin De Rojas\*, Dr. Joshua Kim\*, Dr. Priya Mathews\*, Dr. David Shoemaker\*, Dr. William Soscia\*, Dr. Elizabeth Davis\* |
| **LEA**  | Dr. Vinay Gutti, Dr. Scot Holman, Dr. Scott Wehrly |
| **RHC**  | (No providers listed) |
| **SFEC** | Dr. Albert Smolyar\* |

> `*` Performs biometry day of consult

### Important Reminders

- If the appointment is >10 days out, offer to add patient to waitlist (in addition to scheduling).
- Consultations are valid for **3 months**.
- Surgery measurements (biometry/AVT) are valid for **6 months**.
- **Vision plans cannot be used** for cataract consults.
- Self-pay = **Refractive consult**

### Process

#### If Patient Has Referral

**Criteria:**

- Diagnosed cataracts ready for removal
- Complaints of blurry vision, glare, or night driving difficulty

**Instructions:**

1. Schedule with preferred provider.
2. If no preferred provider, schedule with first available in patient's preferred location.
3. Note contact lens status and discontinuation timing in appointment details (see chart below).

#### If Patient Does NOT Have Referral

1. Check Phreesia or ICP for documentation.
2. Ask about last eye exam. If >1 year ago, follow **Primary Eye Care Protocol**.
3. Request fax of last eye exam if diagnosis is unclear.
4. If exam is vague, send ICP communication to the provider team to confirm readiness.
5. Document **records status** in "Physician Relations / Records."
6. Enter surgeon's name in **Referring Physician** field (never leave blank).
*(Follow standard [Referral Management Protocol](#referral-management-protocol))*

**Additional Criteria for Patients WITHOUT Referral:**
- Before scheduling a Cataract Consult for a self-referral, confirm they meet typical criteria (e.g., age > 55-60, experiencing symptoms like blurry vision, glare, night driving difficulty).
- If unsure based on patient description or if last exam was >1 year ago, consider scheduling for [Primary Eye Care](#scheduling-primary-eye-care) first, or request records per the protocol.
- If patient insists on Cataract consult despite lack of clear diagnosis/recent exam, document this clearly.

### Contact Lens Guidelines

**Script Prompt:**  
*"Wearing contact lenses can affect the shape of your cornea. To ensure accurate surgical measurements, you must stop wearing contacts before your consultation. What type of contact lenses do you wear?"*

> For detailed guidance on contact lens discontinuation periods and requirements, see the [Contact Lens Discontinuation for Consultations](#contact-lens-discontinuation-for-consultations) section.

> Remember to add "DNM" (Do Not Move) to appointment details for patients requiring contact lens discontinuation to prevent Appointment Accelerator from offering earlier slots before the discontinuation period is met.

#### Contact Lens Discontinuation Periods

## Scheduling Cornea

### Cornea Overview

- **Definition**  
  The cornea is the eye's clear, outermost tissue, acting like a window to let light in and help focus images on the retina. Various conditions—from dry eyes to scarring—can affect corneal clarity.

- **Common Conditions and Procedures**  
  - Keratoconus (that could require corneal crosslinking or CTAK)
  - Fuchs' Dystrophy or corneal edema (that could require corneal transplantion such as DMEK)
  - Pterygium or Pinguecula (that could require excision and graft placement)
  - Prior surgical complications or trauma to front of the eye (that could require complex anterior segment surgery, IOL exchange, secondary lens placement, or iris repair (**Dr. Elizabeth Davis** only))  
  - Severe dry eye and ocular surface disease (must be referred by an optometrist; that could require dry eye treatments as explained below)

### Providers

| Location | Doctors |
| -------- | ------- |
| **CFS**  | Dr. Joaquin De Rojas, Dr. Priya Mathews, Dr. Elizabeth Davis\*, Maureen Traina, PA (dry eye only), Dr. Jon Berlie (Naples) |
| **LEA**  | Dr. Vinay Gutti, Dr. Scott Wehrly |

### Important Reminders

- If you are offering an appointment more than 10 days away, place the patient on the waitlist.  
- Vision plans **cannot** be used for cornea consultations.

### Contact Lens Discontinuation

For cornea consultations - especially for keratoconus evaluations - patients should discontinue contact lens wear according to the standard guidelines.

> For detailed guidance on contact lens discontinuation periods and requirements, see the [Contact Lens Discontinuation for Consultations](#contact-lens-discontinuation-for-consultations) section.

### Process

#### If Patient Has Referral

1. Check Phreesia/ICP Documents to confirm the referral is for a Cornea Consultation.  
2. Have the patient's last note or referral sent in if not found.  
3. Schedule with the referring provider (the name on the referral).

#### If Patient Does **Not** Have Referral

1. Confirm the patient was diagnosed with a cornea condition by a physician (internal or external).  
2. Alert the patient that records are required; the appointment may be canceled if records don't arrive. Schedule at least **1 week out** (mark **DNM** in details).  
3. Document the records status in the Physician Relations / Records field.  
4. If no surgeon preference, offer the next available at the requested/most convenient location.  
5. Enter the surgeon's name in the Referring Physician field to indicate self-referral (never leave it blank).

### FAQs

1. **Q:** Do cornea consultations require dilation?  
   **A:** Yes (except for dry eye only appointments).  
   > "As part of the examination process, your eyes will be dilated to allow for a thorough assessment of your eye health. Due to the dilation, your vision may become blurry and your eyes more sensitive to light for several hours afterward. For your safety and comfort, it's important to have someone accompany you to the appointment who can drive you home afterward."
   - Advise patient dilation is required. *(See [Dilation Key](#dilation-key) for standard scripting)*

2. **Q:** How long do cornea consultations last?  
   **A:** Typically 2–3 hours.  
   > "Due to the complexity of the exam and the comprehensive nature of the diagnostic testing we'll be conducting, your consultation is likely to last between two to three hours. This extended time is necessary to ensure we gather all the information needed to provide you with the best possible care."

### Closing Reminders

- Ask if there is anything else you can assist with.  
- Advise the patient of dilation and 2–3 hour duration.  
- Encourage Phreesia pre-registration 5 days prior to appointment.  
> "Five days prior to your appointment, you will receive a message from Phreesia, our registration platform. Please confirm your appointment and complete the registration. This ensures a faster check-in and allows us to focus more on your care. Contact our office with any questions."

### Clinical Questions / Medications / DMV Forms – ICP Patient Tasks

Certain requests **only** clinical staff or providers can handle. Refer to the table below to know how to notify the correct group in ICP (IntelleChartPRO). Clinical staff monitor ICP tasks throughout the day and aim to respond within the same day if received in the morning or by the next day if received in the afternoon.

#### Important Notes

- **Do Not** send ICP communications to groups prefixed with `zzz` (inactive).  
- If a provider no longer works here and the patient hasn't established care with another provider, send the message to the **Patient Care Team by region** (Florida) 
- Patients should be informed that the request is typically handled within **24–48 hours**.  
- **New Patients**: If they have clinical or medication questions, they must be scheduled for an appointment. Clinical staff cannot advise or fill out forms (DMV, tint, medical forms) without a prior exam.

### Surgical Procedures

#### Procedures are NOT scheduled by the PAC

#### Surgical Inquiries Handling

1.  **Identify** where the patient is having surgery and which surgeon. Include this info in your message.  
2.  **Create a Patient Task** in ICP (Task Category: **Surgery**, Urgency: **High**).  
   - **Notify Patient Care Counselors (PCCs)** ICP groups for cash-pay procedures (CV, ADV, LAL, LASIK, refractive, cosmetic, etc)
   - **Notify Surgical Schedulers** in all other cases.

**Never provide surgery times**

Messages to surgical counselor ICP group for:  
- Surgery **cancellation** (if within 24–48 hours, also notify the provider team + email ASC if relevant).  
- Surgery **rescheduling** (including post-ops).  
- **Surgery scheduling**.  
- **Surgical** questions → provider team.

**Surgery Time & Pre-Op**:

- For **Santa Fe Surgery Center (LEA)** or **Southwest Florida Eye (SFEC)**, create ICP task for the practice surgical counselors.  
- For Laser & Surgical Services (Center For Sight-US41 Sarasota): email [srq-ascinquiries@useye.com](mailto:srq-ascinquiries@useye.com).

- For Santa Fe Surgery Center (LEA): email [santafeasc@useye.com](mailto:santafeasc@useye.com).  
  - Include patient name, DOB, surgery center, and surgeon.

**Post-Op** questions → **Provider Team** in ICP, **not** the surgical counselor group.
