## 7. Clinical Questions / Medications / DMV Forms – ICP Patient Tasks

Certain requests **only** clinical staff or providers can handle. Refer to the table below to know how to notify the correct group in ICP (IntelleChartPRO). Clinical staff monitor ICP tasks throughout the day and aim to respond within the same day if received in the morning or by the next day if received in the afternoon.

### Important Notes

- **Do Not** send ICP communications to groups prefixed with `zzz` (inactive).  
- If a provider no longer works here and the patient hasn't established care with another provider, send the message to the **Patient Care Team by region** (Florida) 
- Patients should be informed that the request is typically handled within **24–48 hours**.  
- **New Patients**: If they have clinical or medication questions, they must be scheduled for an appointment. Clinical staff cannot advise or fill out forms (DMV, tint, medical forms) without a prior exam.

## 8. Surgical Procedures

### Procedures are **Not** Scheduled by PAC


### Surgical Inquiries Handling

1. **Identify** where the patient is having surgery and which surgeon. Include this info in your message.  
2. **Create a Patient Task** in ICP (Task Category: **Surgery**, Urgency: **High**).  
   - **Notify Surgical Counselers** ICP groups for cash-pay procedures (CV, ADV, LAL, LASIK, refractive, cosmetic, etc)
   - **Notify Practice (Provider) Team** in all other cases.

**Never provide surgery times**

Messages to surgical counselor ICP group for:  
- Surgery **cancellation** (if within 24–48 hours, also notify the provider team + email ASC if relevant).  
- Surgery **rescheduling** (including post-ops).  
- **Surgery scheduling**.  
- **Surgical** questions → provider team.

**Surgery Time & Pre-Op**:

- For **Santa Fe Surgery Center (LEA)** or **Southwest Florida Eye (SFEC)**, create ICP task for the practice surgical counselors.  
- For Laser & Surgical Services (Center For Sight-US41 Sarasota): email [srq-ascinquiries@useye.com](mailto:srq-ascinquiries@useye.com).  
- For Montgomery Eye (Center for Sight Naples): email [naples-ascinquiries@useye.com](mailto:naples-ascinquiries@useye.com).  
- For Santa Fe Surgery Center (LEA): email [santafeasc@useye.com](mailto:santafeasc@useye.com).  
  - Include patient name, DOB, surgery center, and surgeon.

**Post-Op** questions → **Provider Team** in ICP, **not** the surgical counselor group.

## 9. Optical

Incoming calls for **Optical** route to designated regional ring groups.  
- All optical staff must assist in answering calls when not busy with in-office patients.  
- Unanswered calls go to a group voicemail (checked daily).  
- Voicemails should be returned same business day.

### Contact Lens Phone Orders
- If a patient wants to **order** contact lens supplies, **transfer** to the appropriate Optical Department.  
- For **trial pair** or a single pair, the provider's approval is required:
  - Enter an ICP message to the **Provider Team**.  
- **Optical staff** confirm the prescription is signed in ICP and place an order in NextGen Optical Management. Payment is taken via Phreesia.  
- If the caller cannot be transferred to optical (or if they already left a voicemail), escalate to a **team lead/manager**.
