## Important Reminders

1. **Refraction rechecks** should always be scheduled with the **same provider** who performed the comprehensive exam. Patients should consult an optician first to check their glasses before scheduling a refraction recheck.  
2. If a patient **hasn't been seen in 3+ months**, a **comprehensive exam** is scheduled, **not** just a refraction.  
3. **CFS/SFEC/LEA**: Do not schedule more than **two family members** in one day **per provider**.  
4. If you offer an appointment more than **10 days out**, you **must** offer to place the patient on the **waitlist**.

## Process

1. **OD vs. MD/DO**  
   - **Optometrists (OD)** can treat, diagnose, and prescribe for most eye conditions. If surgery is needed, the OD will refer to a Surgeon.

2. **New vs. Established**  
   - If it's been **more than three years** since the patient's last exam, schedule them using the appropriate **new patient** event.  
   - For **Routine Employee** exams, see the **Employee Exams Protocol**.  
   - **Vision plans** can only be used for **Routine Vision** exams. Check insurance acceptance, and ensure both medical + vision are listed in NextGen.

3. **Contact Lens (CL) Fittings**  
   - **Established** patient with a CL fitting:
     - If not seen in **over one year**, schedule a **Comprehensive Exam** and note "CL" in details. The provider decides if the fitting can occur then or needs a separate visit.  
   - Confirm **type of lenses** in the appointment details, and ensure you schedule with a provider who fits that lens.  
   - Patients must **wear** their contact lenses to the appointment and **bring** their lens prescription/info.  
   - **New patients** cannot be scheduled directly for a Contact Lens Fitting. Schedule a **Comp Medical or Routine Vision** as a new patient exam instead. The provider will decide if the fitting can occur or if a separate appointment is required.  
   - If externally referred for **specialty contact lens** (e.g., scleral), schedule at least **one week** out and use "DNM" in details to block early changes through Appointment Accelerator.

## FAQs

1. **Dilation**  
   - Comprehensive & routine exams usually **require dilation**.  
   - **Script**: "As part of the exam, your eyes will be dilated, leading to blurry vision and light sensitivity for a few hours. We suggest having someone drive you home."

2. **Exam Duration**  
   - Comprehensive exams generally last **90–120 minutes**.  
   - **Script**: "Because of the complexity and diagnostic testing, we usually need about 90 minutes. This ensures thorough care."

## Closing Reminders

1. Ask if there's anything else the patient needs.  
2. **Routine vs. Medical** Coverage Note:  
   > "Your routine eye exam is on [date/time]. If a medical condition is found, the physician will let you know about any insurance or financial responsibilities before proceeding with treatment that day. You can choose to proceed immediately or schedule the care for another time."  
3. Encourage completing the **Phreesia** pre-visit workflow ~5 days before the appointment.  
4. Thank the patient and confirm date/time/location. If different from their usual location, **emphasize** the change.  
   - **Suggested**: "Thank you [Mr./Ms. Patient Last Name]. We look forward to seeing you for your comprehensive eye exam on [date] at [time] at our [office] location."
