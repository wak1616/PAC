## Status Legend

<div class="status-legend">
<p><strong>PAR</strong>: Participating (PAR) providers contract with the patient's health plan. There is a direct contract between the provider/practice and an insurance company that allows our claims to be processed and paid, based on our contracted amounts negotiated per CPT code. Patients save a considerable amount of money when they are seen by a participating provider than a non-participating provider.</p>

<p><strong>Non-PAR-OON Benefits</strong>: If a patient has a plan NON-PAR or OON, they may have OON benefits. OON benefits may be available with PPO plans. OON with benefits means that the insurance company will pay us based on usual and customary (U&C), but not based on a contract since the provider/practice does not have a direct contract with the payer. If the patient has OON benefits, the insurance typically applies a higher benefit (i.e., copay is $40 to see a participating provider, but may increase to $75 due to OON, etc.)</p>

<p><strong>Non-PAR</strong>: Non-participating (NON-PAR) means the provider/practice does not have a contract with the patient's health plan. This is also called a non-preferred provider or OUT-OF-NETWORK (OON). If the patient chooses to be seen by a non-participating provider, the patient will pay more as a self-pay patient. OON plans may or may not have OON benefits. HMO plans do not have OON benefits, therefore, the patient must be seen as self-pay.</p>
